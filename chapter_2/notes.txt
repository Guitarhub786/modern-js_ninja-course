letters, numbers, underscors or '$' dollar signs

or use reserve keywords

JavasScript Data Types
Number   1,2,3,100,3.14
String   'hello, world"
Boolean  true / false
Null     Explicitly set a variable with no value
Undefine For variables that have not yet been defined
Object   Complex data structures - Arrays, Dates, Literals etc.
Symbol   (New edition) Used with objects

A variable can hold any data type.
We don't have to explicitly say what type of data it will store.
We can override a variable with a different type with 'let'.
That's why javascript is know as a loosly typed language, in contrast to a strongly type language like Ruby, Python.
